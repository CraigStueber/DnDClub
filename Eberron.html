		<p>Where our story begins</p>
		<p >Once the heart of Sharn, Lower Dura has slowly decayed as the rest of the city moved higher into the sky. Now it is a dark and dangerous place. Precarious and the Stores play important roles in the economy of the city, but the other districts have largely been left to fester and rot. Today, Lower Dura is home to the miserable poor. The Sharn Watch rarely risks patrolling Lower Dura, and the ward has become a center for criminal activities. The inhabitants of the ward may be shielded by gang allegiances, ties to one of the major criminal organizations, or the simple fact of having nothing to steal, but adventurers had best tread lightly and keep weapons near at hand when venturing here. Street violence occurs on a regular basis, amateur and professional cutpurses abound, and the Sharn Watch won’t do much to help. A drawn blade and a successful DC 15 Intimidate check made when entering the district keep most of the rabble away—of course, the more dangerous criminals may see this as challenge and a promise of worthy loot.
In general, Lower Dura is a wretched place, and the city council does little to change that. Everburning torches light most of the district, as opposed to everbright lanterns, and in the worst neighborhoods many of the torches have been shattered or stolen. The ward shows its age, with cracked and worn streets, walls covered with mildew and graffiti, and other signs of neglect and wear and tear. Once Lower Dura was Sharn, and it included a garrison, manors for the city lords, a great temple, and other important buildings. Over the course of time these structures have been forgotten or repurposed. Lower Dura is full of the shadows of a glorious past that can barely be seen beneath the grime of the present.

<div id="inMoney" class='boo'>
<p>The money system we are using is super simple.</p>
<p>1 copper = 1 penny</p>
<p>1 silver = 100 copper or a dollar</p>
<p>1 gold = 100 silver</p>
<p>1 platium = 100gold or 10,000 silver</p>
<p>Thinks are priced like this. 1.00.00.00</p>
<p>Prices for things are based on modern prices for things. So if you spend 10$ for a lunch, well that would be 10 silver. If a hotel cost 100$ a night, then that will be 1 gold or 100 silver.</p>

		<h2>Dwarves</h2>
		<p>Quite a few stereotypes about dwarves have been going around Khorvaire for as long as humans have been there about dwarves being Drunk, Greedy, and Rude. Very little was known about the Great Dwarf House of Kundarak. Dwarves who are found in every city through out Khorvaire, have been known to sing great songs and tell tales of the House Kundarak the last Great House. Long thought of as just stories. When the Last war broke out, and the battles grew near Icehorn Mountains. From the tallest mountain in the range, rose up from the mountain itself a fleet of airships, larger than ever thought possible. The fleet headed west over the seas. Leaving the remaining dwarves of Khorvaire to find homes among the cities of the other races to find work as they may.</p>
